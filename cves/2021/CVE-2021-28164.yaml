id: CVE-2021-28164

info:
  name: Jetty Authorization Before Parsing and Canonicalization
  author: noamrathaus
  severity: high
  description: |
    Requests to the ConcatServlet and WelcomeFilter are able to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. For example a request to the ConcatServlet with a URI of /concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml can retrieve the web.xml file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application.
    This occurs because both ConcatServlet and WelcomeFilter decode the supplied path to verify it is not within the WEB-INF or META-INF directories. It then uses this decoded path to call RequestDispatcher which will also do decoding of the path. This double decoding allows paths with a doubly encoded WEB-INF to bypass this security check.
