id: CVE-2022-0679

info:
  name: Narnoo Distributor <= 2.5.1 - Unauthenticated LFI to Arbitrary File Read / RCE
  author: Veshraj
  severity: critical
  description: The plugin fails to validate and sanitize the lib_path parameter before it is passed into a call to require() via the narnoo_distributor_lib_request  AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users) which results in the disclosure of arbitrary files as the content of the file is then displayed in the response as JSON data. This could also lead to RCE with various tricks but depends on the underlying system and it's configuration.
