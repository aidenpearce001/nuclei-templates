  description: Your WordPress site is currently configured so that anyone can register as a user. If you are not using this functionality, it's recommended to disable user registration as it caused some security issues in the past and is increasing the attack surface.
  remediation: Disable user registration if not needed. To disable user registration, log in as an administrator and go to Settings -> General and uncheck "Anyone can register".
